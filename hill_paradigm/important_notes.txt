# Key features of the model in this folder #
############################################

# The test sets that should be used do not feature information about interaction on the input layer. Rather, during test, the model is presented with the memory vector, which encodes whether the particular helper or hinderer, formerly engaged in concordant action, discordant action, or no action as well as the pattern of activation that corresponds to the helper and hinderers.

# During "pretraining_action" networks learned that some agents (concordant agents) engaged in concordant action with other agents and other agents (discordant agents) engaged in discordant action with other agents. In addition, they learned that objects do not engage in any kind of action with other objects. Finally, they learned that when agents were paired with objects, there was no action between the agents and objects. Critically, during this phase, no information about whether a particular agent or object had the capacity to interact with other entities and objects was provided.

# During the "pretraining_interaction," the same agents were shown from the "pretraining_action" events along with a memory vector group that encoded whether a particular agent or object had, in the past (i.e., during the "pretraining_action" events), engaged in concordant, discordant, or no action with other objects and agents. Critically, each agent (i.e., the concordant and discordant agents) were shown twice. The first time the concordant agents were shown, networks learned that they had the capacity to interact. Importantly, the first unit in the "memory vector" was turned on to indicate the fact that this agent had engaged in concordant action with another agent during the "pretraining_action" events. The second time the concordant agents were shown, networks learned that they did not have the capacity to interact, and the third unit in the corresponding memory vector was turned on to denote the fact that the agent had also formerly been shown alongside an object. Finally, the third time the concordant agents were shown, networks learned again that they did have the capacity to interact, and again the third unit of the memory vector was turned on. Note that two of these three presentations of the same concordant agents instantiated the fact that agents that engage in concordant action with other agents tend unequivocally to have the capacity to interact with other agents but concordant agents that engage in no action with objects are at chance in whether they go on to "interact" with, and thus have the capacity for interaction, objects. The discordant agents were presented in exactly the same way as the concordant agents except that when teh second unit of the memory vector was turned on, this indicated that the discordant agent had formerly engaged in discordant action with other agents and also these discordant agents were shown not to have the capacity for interaction. This instantiates the assumption that agents that engage in discordant action with other agents are less likely to go on to interact with those agents and thus presumably are perceived to have less of a capacity for itneraction relative to concordant agents.

- For the model in this folder, there is a "memory" group that consists of 3 units. The first unit is turned on if the agent had engaged in concordant action with another agent during the "pretraining_action" events. The second unit is turned on if the agent had engaged in discordant action with another agent. The third unit is turned on if the agent had engaged in no action with an object.
	- Note that this group of units is only used during the "pretraining_interaction" phase AS WELL AS during the test phase.
